Initial of my first name created using a grid of ellipses. The grid was created using variables in the x and y values.

A custom shape created using a function. I placed multiple ellipses of different sizes and colors to create a new type of "shape", although I wish I blended them a bit more using no fill and moving them closer so it looks morer like a shape rather than shapes together.

Assignment 2.3 was similar to assignment 2.2, and may have even been the same for me. All that needed to be done was add a translation and a scale, which I believe I had done in the previous assignment, allowing me to edit the size and position of the entire shape.

for this assignment I created a custom flag out of two flags with the same first letter as my initials. I chose Saint Lucia and Japan, and I kept the design of the circle and triangle in each of the flags, and then created the custom flag with stripes and a color scheme of both flags combined.
